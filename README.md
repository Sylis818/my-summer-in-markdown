# My Summer in Markdown
## Introduction
My name is Sylis Noor, and I am a senior at CCHS. Over the summer, I did multiple fun and exciting activities. 
## Summer Travel Experiences
One thing that I did over the summer was, I wen't to Florida for a week to visit my grandparents. We went during 4th of July week so we got to see fireworks while we were there visiting. 
## Summer Activity
An activity that I did over the summer was playing the new "Elden Ring" DLC, "Shadow of the Erdtree". I played it right when it came out and I played consistantly for about a week. It was very fun and me and my friends would talk while we were playing it. 
## Favorite Movie I Watched During Summer
My favorite movie that I watched during the summer was "Jujutsu Kaisen 0". I watched this movie in a call with my friends and I really enjoyed the story and the action in it.
