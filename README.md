# My Summer in Markdown
## Introduction

## Summer Travel Experiences
One thing that I did over the summer was, I wen't to Florida for a week to visit my grandparents. We went during 4th of July week so we got to see fireworks while we were there visiting.

## Summer Activity
An activity that I did over the summer was playing the new "Elden Ring" DLC, "Shadow of the Erdtree". I played it right when it came out and I played consistantly for about a week. It was very fun and me and my friends would talk while we were playing it.

## Favorite Movie I Watched During Summer
My favorite movie that I watched during the summer was "Jujutsu Kaisen 0". I watched this movie in a call with my friends and I really enjoyed the story and the action in it.

## My Goals for the School year
Going into my final year of high school I have a few goals. One of my goals is to end with good grades. I also want to submit all of my work on time because I have had a problem with submitting work late for these last few years. I also am hoping to learn a lot about coding and improving my skills.
